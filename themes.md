# Principal Themes in the Exposition

## First Theme (Primary Theme)
The first theme of the exposition in Brahms's Symphony No. 3, first movement, is characterized by a lyrical, rising melodic contour in F major. It opens with the distinctive three-note "F-A-F" motto (Frei aber froh) presented in the violins, which serves as both a melodic and harmonic foundation. The theme unfolds with a sense of pastoral warmth, typical of Brahms's middle-period symphonic writing, and features a gentle rhythmic pulse in 4/4 time.

## Second Theme (Secondary Theme)
The second theme appears in the dominant key (C major) and introduces a more expansive, singing melody in the cellos and violas. It contrasts with the first theme by its more legato, cantabile character and longer phrase structures. This theme often incorporates sequential patterns and subtle chromatic inflections, creating a rich harmonic palette that anticipates the development section.

Both themes are integral to the sonata form structure of the movement and are subject to extensive development and transformation throughout the symphony.
