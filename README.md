# brahms-sym3-analysis
Collaborative digital humanities project for digital analysis of Brahms's Symphony No. 3, first movement

This project aims to create a collaborative, annotated online edition of the first movement of Brahms's Symphony No. 3. It combines a machine-readable version of the score with scholarly commentary and analytical data. The project serves as a teaching resource and a foundation for further research. A key motivic element to be analyzed is Brahms's "F-A-F" motto (Frei aber froh), which permeates the symphony's structure.
